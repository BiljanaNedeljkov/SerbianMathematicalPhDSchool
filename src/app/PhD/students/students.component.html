He graduated from elementary school „Učitelj Tasa“ in Niš, Serbia, class of 2008, as a bearer of „Vuk Karadžić“ award (perfect GPA and awards in mathematics and physics competitons). He graduated from grammar school „Svetozar Marković“ in Niš, class of 2012, module „advanced mathematics, physics and computer science“, again as a bearer of „Vuk Karadžić“ award. He attended Mathematics Summer School at research centre „Petnica“ durring summer in 2011 and in 2012.</p>
              <p>On fall 2012 he started BA in Mathematics at Faculty of Science and Mathematics, University of Niš, and graduated from the University in 2015, as an Honoring student, with perfect GPA (10/10). In summer 2015, Bogdan had already started his scientific research, at that moment, in the field of matrix analysis, and had presented his work on scientific congress GFTA held in Ohrid, FYR Macedonia, in July 2015 (these results were later published in 2016 in Annallele stiintifite Un. Al. I. Cuiza din Yassi, ser. Mathematica). On fall 2015, Bogdan started MA Mathematic at Faculty of Science and Mathematics, Universityof Niš, and had graduated once again as an Honoring student in 2017, thesis title: „Solving the Sylvester matrix equation“ (in Serbian).  Durring his BA and MA studies, Bogdan was funded by national grants and stipends issued by Ministry of Science, Education and Technical Development of Republic of Serba and by Ministry of Youth and Sports (Republic of Serbia). He recieved a plaque from city of Niš for being the best graduate student from Faculty of Science and Mathematics, University of Niš, in the school year 2016/17. In 2017 He won an award given by Serbian Academy of Acience and Arts for having the best master thesis in the field of mathematics, mechanics and computer science.</p>
              <p>On fall 2017, Bogdan started PhD School of Mahtematics, module analysis, at the same faculty. So far, he has the perfect GPA (10/10) and has broaded his field of research to functional analysis, operator theory and their applications. He has published four scientific papers in this field and is active reviewer for prestigious scientific mathematical journals, such as Linear Multilinear Algebra (T&F) and Complex Analysis and Operator Theory (Springer). So far, he has given four talks in scientific congresses and workshops. He is currently working on his PhD concerning operator equations and their applications.</p>
              <p>Since 2016, Bogdan has been involved in teaching activites at Faculty of Science and Mathematics, University of Niš, Serbia, and volunteers as teaching assistant in courses of Real and Complex Mathematical Analysis. Since 2018, he teaches mathematics part time in grammar school „Svetozar Marković“, module „advanced mathematics, physics and computer science.“</p>

  <h2>They said about us:</h2>
  <p>PhD School of Mathemacis is an amazing oportunity for every PhD student in Serbia. It is a unique chance to
      broaden scientific knowledge and master new mathematical techniques. The courses held at the School are tought
      by leading experts in the respected fields, both foreign and domestic, among whom are members of Serbian Academy
      of Science and Arts. The professors are always available and open for discussion. The classes are designed in a
      manner where the students get to meet their peers from other universities and exchange their scientific
      expericence. This way, PhD students get to learn about new topics and their actualities. Instittutions that
      participate in the programe have strong colaboration and mobility of the students is endorsed whenever
      necessary.
      Being a young researcher in the era where versatility and multidisciplinarity are means of necessity rahter than
      sufficiensy, I would strongly reccomend every student who wants to do their PhD in mathematics to apply.<br>
    --Bogdan Đorđević </p>
<p>It was a great oportunity to try something new, a new concept of teaching and learning. My main reason for
    choosing PhD School of Mathematics, rather then other PhD programs, is oportynity to go beyond boundaries of
    Faculty of Science in Kragujevac, where I got my M.Sc. and B.Sc. and connect and share experiences with
    students
    and learn from from other universities, but still with my residence and job in Kragujevac.<br>

  <p>As soon as I heard about DSM I knew that I wanted to be a part of it. After finishing bachelor and master studies at Faculty of sciences which participates in DSM, this was a natural extension of my education. The main strength of DSM is accessibility of professors and their desire to help. I am really happy to be here and I am looking forward to learning more and dealing with new chalenges everyday. I think there is no better start for joining the scientific community.

  <p>During second year of my Master studies at Department of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Novi Sad, I was thinking about PhD studies, possible opportunities in Serbia and abroad, when I heard for Doctoral School of Mathematics (DSM). <br>
      In that moment, it was and still is, combination of several state Mathematical faculties in Serbia, including Mathematical institute of Serbian Academy of Art and Science, with well educate, open minded professors who are available for students during whole year, has wide range of academics contacts all over the world, and on first place desire to help and share their knowledge. <br>
      Depending on their interests, students of DSM are able to choose between two fields of interests, analysis, which I have attended, and algebra. Doctoral studies are “separated” into two parts. First part is taking the exams, which are chosen in agreement with your advisor, in order to fulfill and improve your mathematical knowledge in fields where you are interested in, whereas second part is research and working on your thesis.<br>
      Lectures, books, and other material for courses are in English, which is meaningful, because it prepares us for further work in scientific community, as well as increases our confidence to use English as common as possible.<br>
      All in all, I feel honored to be part this program, with the help of it I have met wonderful people, from professors to students, took several great courses, and visited some interesting places.<br>

    I accidentally found out about DSM while studying for my master’s degree and preparing the thesis. Finding the idea brilliant, I didn’t think twice about joining DSM. Since the Faculty of Science participates in DSM, all information related to the courses  was easily accessible to me, and I was drawn in by their variety and theme. Besides this, the accessibility of the staff and the huge potential for growth is what excites me the most about DSM’s future. I am looking forward to learning more and growing alongside the program, all the while meeting and hopefully collaborating with new collegues and professors.<br>
